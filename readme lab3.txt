# Lab: Interfaces and Abstract Classes

## Description
This lab demonstrates the use of **abstract classes** and **interfaces** in C#. It includes methods to define, implement, and test animal objects using both an abstract class (`Animal`) and an interface (`IAnimal`). The program allows users to create `Dog` and `Cat` objects, interact with their properties, and execute specific behaviors such as eating and crying.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open the `Lab_Interfaces_Abstract.sln` file in Visual Studio.
3. Run the program by pressing `Ctrl + F5`.

## Files Included
- `Lab_Interfaces_Abstract.sln` - Solution file for the project.
- `Lab_Interfaces_Abstract.csproj` - Project configuration file.
- `Program.cs` - Main execution file.

## Project Features
- Implements an abstract class (`Animal`) with properties and an abstract `Eat` method.
- Implements an interface (`IAnimal`) with additional properties and methods (`Eat`, `Cry`).

- Uses a list to store and display animal names.
- Demonstrates the difference between abstract classes and interfaces in OOP.
